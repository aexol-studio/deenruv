Since building an entire Storefront from scratch can be a daunting task, we have prepared a few starter projects that you can use as a base for your own storefront.

These starters provide basic functionality including:

-   Product listing
-   Product details
-   Search with facets
-   Cart functionality
-   Checkout flow
-   Account management
-   Styling with Tailwind

The idea is that you clone the starter project and then customize it to your needs.
