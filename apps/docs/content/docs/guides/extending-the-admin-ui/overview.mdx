The `@deenruv/react-ui-devkit` package is the official UI plugin development kit for the Deenruv Admin Panel. It provides everything you need to build type-safe plugins that extend the admin dashboard with custom pages, components, navigation, widgets, notifications, and more.

## What Does react-ui-devkit Provide?

### Plugin System

A type-safe plugin definition system with **15 extension points** that let you inject custom functionality into every part of the admin panel — pages, tables, tabs, actions, sidebars, navigation, dashboard widgets, notifications, and more.

### Location-Based Injection

A comprehensive set of injection locations across the admin panel:

- **21 list locations** — extend list views for products, orders, customers, and more
- **20 detail locations** — extend detail/edit views with tabs, sidebar components, and actions
- **Modal locations** — inject into admin panel modals

### Component Library

Over **70 components** organized by complexity:

| Category | Count | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Atom | 42 | shadcn/ui-based primitives (Button, Input, Table, Dialog, etc.) |
| Molecule | 13 | Composed components (SearchInput, SortButton, ListTable, etc.) |
| Universal | 15 | Business-logic components (RichTextEditor, AssetPicker, etc.) |
| Template | 2 | Full page layouts (DetailList, DetailView) |
| Core | 4 | Injection markers and renderers |

### Hooks

Purpose-built hooks for admin panel development:

- **`useGFFLP`** — Type-safe form state management driven by GraphQL ModelTypes
- **`useList`** — Paginated list management with sorting, filtering, and URL search params
- **`useTranslation`** — i18n hook bound to the Deenruv i18n instance
- **`useAssets`** — Asset management with pagination and search
- Plus: `useDebounce`, `useLocalStorage`, `useValidators`, `useErrorHandler`

### GraphQL Client

Zeus Thunder-based GraphQL client with automatic `customFields` injection:

- **`apiClient`** — Standard queries and mutations
- **`apiUploadClient`** — File upload mutations
- **`useQuery` / `useLazyQuery` / `useMutation`** — React hooks for declarative data fetching

### State Management

Zustand-based global stores:

- **`useSettings`** — Language, theme, auth token, selected channel
- **`useServer`** — Server config, channels, permissions
- **`useOrder`** — Order detail view state
- **`useGlobalSearch`** — Global search state

### Navigation & Routing

Type-safe route helpers and customizable admin navigation with group IDs.

### i18n

Built-in translation system with per-plugin namespaces.

### Dashboard Widgets

Resizable, configurable dashboard widgets that plugins can register.

### Notifications

Polling-based notification system with configurable placements.

## Architecture Overview

A typical Deenruv plugin with UI consists of two parts:

```
plugins/my-plugin/
  src/
    my-plugin.plugin.ts     # Server-side plugin (@DeenruvPlugin decorator)
    plugin-ui/
      index.tsx              # UI plugin definition (createDeenruvUIPlugin)
      components/            # React components
      pages/                 # Page components for routes
      locales/               # Translation files
      graphql/               # Queries, mutations, selectors
```

The **server plugin** handles backend logic (entities, services, resolvers), while the **UI plugin** defines how the admin panel is extended (pages, navigation, components).

<Callout type="info">
Plugin UI pages are automatically prefixed with `admin-ui/extensions/{plugin-name}/`, so you only need to define relative paths within your plugin.
