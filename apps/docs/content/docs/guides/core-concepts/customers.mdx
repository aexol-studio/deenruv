A `Customer` is a person who can buy from your shop. A customer can have one or more
`Addresses`, which are used for shipping and billing.

If a customer has registered an account, they will have an associated `User`. The user
entity is used for authentication and authorization. **Guest checkouts** are also possible, in which case a customer will not have a user.

<Callout type="info">
See the [Auth guide](/docs/guides/core-concepts/auth/#customer-auth) for a detailed explanation of the relationship between
customers and users.

Customers can be organized into `CustomerGroups`. These groups can be used in
logic relating to promotions, shipping rules, payment rules etc. For example, you could create a "VIP" customer group and then create
a promotion which grants members of this group free shipping. Or a "B2B" group which is used in a custom tax calculator to
apply a different tax rate to B2B customers.
