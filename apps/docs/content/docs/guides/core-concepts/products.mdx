Your catalog is composed of `Products` and `ProductVariants`.
A `Product` always has _at least one_ `ProductVariant`. You can think of the product as a "container" which includes a name, description, and images that apply to all of
its variants.

Here's a visual example, in which we have a "Hoodie" product which is available in 3 sizes. Therefore, we have
3 variants of that product:



Multiple variants are made possible by adding one or more `ProductOptionGroups` to
the product. These option groups then define the available `ProductOptions`

If we were to add a new option group to the example above for "Color", with 2 options, "Black" and "White", then in total
we would be able to define up to 6 variants:

-   Hoodie Small Black
-   Hoodie Small White
-   Hoodie Medium Black
-   Hoodie Medium White
-   Hoodie Large Black
-   Hoodie Large White

<Callout type="info">
When a customer adds a product to their cart, they are adding a specific `ProductVariant` to their cart, not the `Product` itself.
It is the `ProductVariant` that contains the SKU ("stock keeping unit", or product code) and price information.
</Callout>

## Product price and stock

The `ProductVariant` entity contains the price and stock information for a product. Since a given product variant can have more
than one price, and more than one stock level (in the case of multiple warehouses), the `ProductVariant` entity contains
relations to one or more `ProductVariantPrice` entities and
one or more `StockLevel` entities.



## Facets

`Facets` are used to add structured labels to products and variants. A facet has
one or more `FacetValues`. Facet values can be assigned to products or
product variants.

For example, a "Brand" facet could be used to label products with the brand name, with each facet value representing a different brand. You can
also use facets to add other metadata to products and variants such as "New", "Sale", "Featured", etc.



These are the typical uses of facets in Deenruv:

-   As the **basis of [Collections](/docs/guides/core-concepts/collections)**, in order to categorize your catalog.
-   To **filter products** in the storefront, also known as "faceted search". For example, a customer is on the "hoodies" collection
    page and wants to filter to only show Nike hoodies.
-   For **internal logic**, such as a promotion that applies to all variants with the "Summer Sale" facet value, or a shipping calculation
    that applies a surcharge to all products with the "Fragile" facet value. Such facets can be set to be private so that they
    are not exposed to the storefront.
