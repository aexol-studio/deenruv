The Orders section of the Deenruv admin panel lets you manage the complete order lifecycle — from viewing new orders through fulfillment and handling any refunds or modifications.

## The order lifecycle

Every order in Deenruv follows a well-defined state machine. Understanding these states is key to managing orders effectively:

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Created** | An active order in the customer's cart. The customer can still modify it. |
| **ArrangingPayment** | The customer has proceeded to checkout and is arranging payment. |
| **PaymentAuthorized** | Payment has been authorized but not yet settled. |
| **PaymentSettled** | Payment has been successfully settled (captured). |
| **PartiallyShipped** | Some order lines have been fulfilled and shipped. |
| **Shipped** | All order lines have been fulfilled and shipped. |
| **PartiallyDelivered** | Some fulfillments have been marked as delivered. |
| **Delivered** | All fulfillments have been delivered to the customer. |
| **Modifying** | An administrator is modifying the order (adding/removing items, adjusting prices). |
| **ArrangingAdditionalPayment** | Additional payment is required after an order modification. |
| **Cancelled** | The order has been cancelled. |

<Callout type="info">
The order state machine is fully customizable. Your Deenruv instance may have additional custom states or transitions depending on your business requirements. See the [developer guide on strategies](/docs/guides/developer-guide/strategies-configurable-operations) for details.
</Callout>

## Viewing orders

Navigate to **Sales → Orders** in the admin panel sidebar. The order list shows:

- **Order code** — a unique, human-readable identifier (e.g., `T7HKGQR3`)
- **Customer name** and email
- **State** — the current order state with a color-coded badge
- **Total** — the order total including tax and shipping
- **Date placed** — when the customer completed checkout

You can filter orders by state, search by order code or customer name, and sort by date or total.

### Order detail view

Click on an order to see its full details:

- **Order lines** — each item with quantity, unit price, and line total
- **Shipping** — the selected shipping method and cost
- **Payments** — payment method, status, and transaction details
- **Customer** — linked customer account and shipping/billing addresses
- **History** — a full timeline of order events (state changes, notes, modifications)
- **Promotions** — any applied coupon codes or automatic promotions
- **Tax summary** — breakdown of taxes applied to the order

## Fulfilling orders

Fulfillment is the process of shipping order items to the customer.

### Creating a fulfillment

1. Open the order detail view for an order in the **PaymentSettled** state.
2. Click the **Fulfill** button.
3. Select which order lines (and quantities) to include in this fulfillment.
4. Choose a **Fulfillment handler** — this determines how the fulfillment is processed (e.g., manual fulfillment, integration with a shipping provider).
5. Optionally enter a **Tracking code** for the shipment.
6. Click **Fulfill** to create the fulfillment.

The order will transition to **PartiallyShipped** if only some lines are fulfilled, or **Shipped** if all lines are fulfilled.

### Partial fulfillments

Deenruv supports splitting an order into multiple fulfillments. This is useful when:

- Items ship from different warehouses
- Some items are backordered
- Items have different shipping requirements

Each fulfillment tracks its own state independently:

| Fulfillment State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Fulfillment created, not yet handed to carrier |
| **Shipped** | Handed to carrier, in transit |
| **Delivered** | Successfully delivered to customer |
| **Cancelled** | Fulfillment was cancelled |

## Refunds

When a customer requests a return or there is an issue with an order, you can issue a refund.

### Issuing a refund

1. Open the order detail view.
2. Click the **Refund** button.
3. Select the order lines and quantities to refund.
4. Enter the **refund amount** — this is the total amount to be returned to the customer.
5. Optionally add a **reason** for the refund.
6. Click **Refund** to process.

The refund will be processed through the same payment method used for the original payment. The refund entity tracks its own state:

| Refund State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Pending** | Refund created, awaiting processing by payment provider |
| **Settled** | Refund successfully processed and funds returned |
| **Failed** | Refund processing failed |

<Callout type="warn">
The actual refund processing depends on your payment handler implementation. Some payment providers process refunds instantly, while others may take several business days.

## Modifying orders

Administrators can modify orders after they have been placed. This is useful for correcting mistakes, applying manual discounts, or accommodating customer requests.

### Making modifications

1. Open the order detail view.
2. Click **Modify order** to enter modification mode.
3. You can:
   - **Add items** — search for and add new product variants
   - **Remove items** — reduce quantities or remove lines entirely
   - **Adjust prices** — apply manual price overrides
   - **Add surcharges** — add one-off fees or discounts
   - **Update shipping** — change the shipping method
4. Review the modification summary showing the price difference.
5. If the modification results in an additional charge, the order enters the **ArrangingAdditionalPayment** state. If it results in a credit, a refund is automatically processed.

<Callout type="info">
Every modification is recorded in the order history with a note describing what changed. This provides a full audit trail for order changes.
</Callout>

## Cancelling orders

To cancel an order:

1. Open the order detail view.
2. Click **Cancel order**.
3. Select which order lines to cancel (you can partially cancel).
4. Choose a cancellation reason.
5. Confirm the cancellation.

If payment has already been settled, a refund will need to be issued separately.

## Order notes

You can add internal notes to any order for team communication:

1. In the order detail view, scroll to the **History** section.
2. Click **Add note**.
3. Enter your note text.
4. Choose whether the note should be **visible to the customer** (included in order history queries from the Shop API) or **private** (admin-only).
5. Click **Add note**.
