The Settings area of the Deenruv admin panel lets you configure the core aspects of your e-commerce system — from channels and currencies to payment providers, shipping methods, and tax rules.

## Channels

Channels are one of the most powerful features of Deenruv. A Channel represents a distinct sales channel with its own configuration for currency, language, tax, and shipping defaults.

### Use cases for channels

- **Multi-region stores** — a distinct website for each country/territory with its own pricing, currency, and tax rules
- **Marketplace channels** — separate channels for different sellers in a multi-vendor setup
- **Sales channel separation** — different inventory and rules for your website vs. Amazon vs. physical stores
- **Specialized stores** — a subset of your main catalog for a niche audience

### Channel settings

Each channel has the following configurable properties:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Code** | A unique identifier for the channel (e.g., `us-webstore`) |
| **Token** | An auto-generated token used in the `deenruv-token` HTTP header to identify requests to this channel |
| **Default Language** | The primary language for this channel |
| **Available Languages** | Additional languages supported by this channel |
| **Default Currency** | The primary currency code (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP) |
| **Available Currencies** | Additional currencies the channel supports |
| **Default Tax Zone** | The zone used for tax calculations when no customer address is available |
| **Default Shipping Zone** | The zone used for shipping calculations |
| **Prices Include Tax** | Whether product prices are entered inclusive or exclusive of tax |

### Managing channel assignments

Products, collections, facets, shipping methods, payment methods, and promotions can all be assigned to specific channels. Only items assigned to a channel will be available in that channel.

To assign items to a channel, navigate to the entity's detail view and use the **Channels** section to add or remove channel assignments.

<Callout type="info">
The **Default Channel** is created automatically and cannot be deleted. All entities are assigned to the default channel when created. If you are running a single-store setup, you only need the default channel.
</Callout>

## Administrators and Roles

### Managing administrators

Navigate to **Settings → Administrators** to manage admin users. Each administrator has:

- **First name** and **Last name**
- **Email address** — used as the login identifier
- **Roles** — one or more roles that determine what the administrator can do

To create a new administrator:

1. Click **Create administrator**.
2. Fill in the name and email address.
3. Set an initial password.
4. Assign one or more **Roles**.
5. Click **Create**.

### Roles and permissions

Roles define what actions an administrator can perform. Navigate to **Settings → Roles** to manage roles.

Each role consists of:

- **Name** and **Description**
- **Channels** — which channels this role applies to
- **Permissions** — a set of granular permissions controlling access to specific operations

Deenruv provides fine-grained permissions for every area of the system:

| Permission Area | Examples |
|---|---|
| **Catalog** | CreateProduct, ReadProduct, UpdateProduct, DeleteProduct |
| **Orders** | CreateOrder, ReadOrder, UpdateOrder, DeleteOrder |
| **Customers** | CreateCustomer, ReadCustomer, UpdateCustomer, DeleteCustomer |
| **Settings** | ReadSettings, UpdateSettings |
| **System** | ReadAdministrator, CreateAdministrator, ReadChannel, UpdateChannel |

<Callout type="info">
There are two special built-in roles: **SuperAdmin** (has all permissions, cannot be modified) and **Customer** (assigned to all registered customers). All other roles are user-defined.
</Callout>

## Countries and Zones

### Countries

Navigate to **Settings → Countries** to manage the list of countries available in your store. Countries are used for:

- Customer shipping and billing addresses
- Tax and shipping zone membership

Each country has a **name**, **ISO code**, and can be **enabled** or **disabled**.

### Zones

Zones are groupings of countries (or other regions) used for calculating tax rates and shipping eligibility.

To create a zone:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Zones**.
2. Click **Create zone**.
3. Enter a **Name** for the zone (e.g., "EU", "North America", "Domestic").
4. Add **Members** — select the countries that belong to this zone.
5. Click **Create**.

Zones are referenced by:
- **Tax rates** — to determine which tax rate applies based on the customer's location
- **Channels** — as the default tax zone and default shipping zone
- **Shipping methods** — to determine eligibility based on the shipping address

## Payment Methods

Payment methods define how customers can pay for their orders.

### Configuring a payment method

1. Navigate to **Settings → Payment methods**.
2. Click **Create payment method**.
3. Enter a **Name** and **Code**.
4. Select a **Handler** — this is the payment integration that processes the actual payment. Available handlers depend on which payment plugins are installed (e.g., Stripe, Mollie, Braintree).
5. Configure the handler's settings (API keys, webhook URLs, etc.).
6. Optionally add an **Eligibility Checker** to restrict when this payment method is available.
7. Assign the payment method to the relevant **Channels**.
8. **Enable** the payment method.
9. Click **Create**.

<Callout type="info">
Deenruv ships with a `dummyPaymentHandler` for development and testing. For production, install a payment plugin such as `@deenruv/payments-plugin` which provides Stripe, Mollie, and Braintree handlers.
</Callout>

## Shipping Methods

Shipping methods determine how orders are shipped and at what cost.

### Configuring a shipping method

1. Navigate to **Settings → Shipping methods**.
2. Click **Create shipping method**.
3. Enter a **Name** and **Code**.
4. Select an **Eligibility Checker** — this determines whether the shipping method is available for a given order. The default checker filters by order weight or order total.
5. Select a **Calculator** — this calculates the shipping price. The default calculator uses a flat rate.
6. Configure the checker and calculator arguments (e.g., minimum order total, flat rate amount).
7. Select a **Fulfillment Handler** — this defines how fulfillments are processed when this shipping method is used.
8. Assign the method to relevant **Channels**.
9. Click **Create**.

### Shipping method eligibility

The eligibility checker runs for every order to determine if a shipping method should be offered. Common eligibility rules include:

- Minimum or maximum order total
- Shipping address must be in a specific zone
- Order must contain (or not contain) specific facet values

## Tax Settings

Deenruv's tax system is based on **Tax Categories**, **Tax Rates**, and **Zones**.

### Tax categories

Tax categories classify products by their tax treatment. Navigate to **Settings → Tax categories** to manage them. Common examples:

- **Standard** — default tax rate
- **Reduced** — reduced rate for essentials (food, books)
- **Zero** — zero-rated items
- **Exempt** — tax-exempt items

Each product variant is assigned to a tax category.

### Tax rates

Tax rates define the actual percentage of tax to apply. Navigate to **Settings → Tax rates** to manage them.

Each tax rate has:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Descriptive name (e.g., "US Sales Tax", "EU VAT Standard") |
| **Rate** | The percentage (e.g., 20 for 20%) |
| **Tax Category** | Which products this rate applies to |
| **Zone** | Which geographic zone this rate applies to |
| **Customer Group** | Optionally restrict to a specific customer group |

The applicable tax rate for a given product variant is determined by:

1. The variant's **Tax Category**
2. The customer's applicable **Zone** (determined by the configured Tax Zone Strategy)
3. Optionally, the customer's **Customer Group**

<Callout type="info">
Configure the **Prices Include Tax** setting on your Channel to control whether prices are entered tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive. This is important for regions where tax-inclusive pricing is the norm (e.g., EU) vs. regions where tax is added at checkout (e.g., US).
</Callout>

## Global Settings

Global settings are application-wide configuration values. Navigate to **Settings → Global Settings** to view and update them.

<Callout type="warn">
Many settings that were previously global (such as inventory tracking and out-of-stock threshold) have been moved to the **Channel** level. Check your channel settings for these options.
