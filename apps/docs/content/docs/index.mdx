# Welcome to Deenruv

Deenruv is a modern, headless e-commerce platform built on **NestJS** and **GraphQL**. It provides a robust, extensible foundation for building online stores of any scale — from small shops to multi-channel, multi-vendor marketplaces.

</Callout>

## Quick Start

```bash
npx @deenruv/create my-shop
```

This scaffolds a new project, installs dependencies, and sets up a development server with a SQLite database. Once running, you can access:

- **Admin UI** at `http://localhost:3000/admin`
- **Shop API** at `http://localhost:3000/shop-api`
- **Admin API** at `http://localhost:3000/admin-api`

## Key Features

- **Headless architecture** — use any frontend framework (Next.js, Remix, Nuxt, Expo, etc.)
- **GraphQL API** — fully typed Shop and Admin APIs with code generation support
- **Plugin system** — extend every aspect of the platform without forking
- **Multi-channel** — sell across multiple storefronts, currencies, and languages from one backend
- **TypeScript-first** — end-to-end type safety across the entire stack
- **Worker-based jobs** — offload heavy tasks (emails, imports, search indexing) to background workers

## Architecture Overview

Deenruv follows a layered architecture:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **API Layer** | GraphQL resolvers handle incoming requests and delegate to services |
| **Service Layer** | Business logic, database access, and event publishing |
| **Plugin System** | Extend entities, APIs, services, and the Admin UI |
| **Worker** | Background job processing via BullMQ |
| **Admin UI** | React-based admin panel with a plugin-extensible UI |
